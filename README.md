# Iris-flowers-classification
This project focuses on the classification of different species of iris flowers using logistic regression. By considering the length of petals and sepals, the machine learning model can identify the species accurately. The Jupyter notebook code provides comprehensive explanations of the data preprocessing, model training, and classification process.
